# Quantum-Enhanced-ML-Applications  
**⚠️ This repository is a work in progress and currently under development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!**

## Overview  
This repository explores the implementation of **hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms**, inspired by cutting-edge research in quantum-enhanced machine learning. The focus is on leveraging quantum computing platforms like **Qiskit**, **Cirq**, and others to solve problems in computer vision and beyond.

Key highlights include:
- **Hybrid Models:** Combining quantum and classical computing approaches.
- **Quantum Algorithms:** Exploring data re-uploading schemes, patch-based GANs, and quantum-enhanced optimization.
- **Applications:** Practical implementations for tasks such as image classification, feature extraction, and generative modeling.

## Project Goals  
1. Demonstrate the potential of quantum computing in enhancing traditional ML tasks.  
2. Implement algorithms discussed in quantum ML research papers.  
3. Provide clear and reproducible code for hybrid quantum-classical models.  
4. Serve as a learning resource for quantum ML enthusiasts.  

## Features  
- **Quantum Data Re-Uploading:** Implementing quantum circuits for efficient data encoding and iterative processing.  
- **Patch-Based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Enhancing image generation with quantum elements.  
- **Quantum Optimization:** Solving ML optimization problems with quantum algorithms.  
- **Visualization:** Using tools to visualize quantum circuits and results.
